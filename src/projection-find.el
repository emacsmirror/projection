;;; Commentary:

;; Facilities for jumping to related files within a project. For example this can
;; be used to jump between C++ declaration and implementation files. It can also
;; respect the project specific test configurations from `projection-types' to be
;; able to jump from implementation to test files and vice versa.

Configures relationships between files with similar base-names and different
extensions. For example foo.h is related to foo.cpp and can be jumped between
each other with `projection-find-other-file' by adding the following mappings
to this configuration:

    ((\"h\" \"cpp\")

In many cases the mapping between extensions should be reciprocal to ensure
you can jump between them from either file but this isn't required."
